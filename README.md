# Lavos

Lavos is a 3D engine framework based on the Vulkan graphics API.

It aims to have a more modular architecture than other engines, such as Unity.
The goal is to provide a collection of components, such as different kinds of renderers and materials,
that can be mixed together to produce exactly the kind of engine that is needed for an application
while being lightweight and not adding anything unnecessary.

Lavos is still in an early development stage. Consider everything experimental and work in progress!
